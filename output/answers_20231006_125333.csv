1,What are time off rules relating child birth?,"Employees are allowed to take special leave for caregiving a child due to injury or illness, or to accompany the child for an immunization or health checkup. Special leave can also be taken to accompany a family member to a medical institution or to complete procedures for nursing services on their behalf. This leave can be taken in 30-minute increments. 

A female employee who is pregnant or has given birth within the past year is exempt from working beyond prescribed work hours, on days off, and late at night. She is also granted the necessary time to receive health advice or undergo health examinations as prescribed by the Maternal and Child Health Act. The frequency of these examinations is determined by the stage of pregnancy and doctor's instructions.

A female employee raising a child under 1 year of age is granted 1 hour per day for child care, which is unpaid. 

Employees are also entitled to maternity leave, spouse's child birth leave, and childcare leave. The rules regarding these leaves are determined separately. 

Employees are required to report to HR as soon as they know about their or their spouse’s pregnancy or childbirth.","Work Rules for Regular and Contract Employees_正社員・契約社員就業規則__P19
